https://github.com/DMTF/spdm-emu/releases/tag/3.2.0, 
This is a bug in 3.2.0, when received the vendor defined request,
libspdm will return error because vendor_response_get_id function
pointer and vendor_response_callback function pointer don't get 
initialized.
Solution: change LIBSPDM_ENABLE_VENDOR_DEFINED_MESSAGES setting to 0!
